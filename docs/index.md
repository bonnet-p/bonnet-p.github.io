## Bio

Philippe Bonnet is an experimental computer scientist with a background in
database systems. For thirty years, Philippe has explored the design, implementation,
and evaluation of database systems in the context of successive generations of computer
classes, including wireless sensor networks, computer clusters and most recently
computational storage. 
Philippe has a track record of successful research projects under DARPA, NSF (while a research associate 
at Cornell University), EU and Danish funding (at DIKU and ITU).

Philippe is an expert on storage system
software. In this area, he contributed to the uFlip Benchmark, the Linux multiqueue block
layer, the Linux framework for Open-Channel SSDs, the OX architecture for computational
storage, the xNVMe library and Delilah, a prototype for eBPF offload on
computational storage.

Philippe was involved in the development of sensor networks in the early 200s. 

Philippe joined DIKU in 2001 as assistant professor in the Distlab group.
He was faculty at the IT University from 2009 to 2023, and he is now back.

Before Denmark, Philippe worked as software engineer at ECRC in Munich, Germany
from 1993 to 1996, and at GIE Dyade in Grenoble, France, where he completed his PhD in 1999. 
He was then a postdoc and later research scientist at Cornell University from 1999 to 2001.
In this period, Philippe had the priviledge to work under the supervision of Stephane Bressan,
Anthony Tomasic and Praveen Seshadri and to collaborate with Dennis Shasha.

Philippe is a trustee of the VLDB Endowment and currently chairs the ACM EIG on Reproducibility
and Replicability.
