## Bio

Philippe Bonnet is professor at DIKU, the computer science department of the University
of Copenhagen. 

He is an experimental computer scientist with a background in
database systems. For thirty years, he has explored the design, implementation,
and evaluation of database systems in the context of successive generations of computer
classes, including wireless sensor networks, computer clusters and most recently
computational storage. 
Philippe has a track record of successful research projects under DARPA, NSF (while a research associate 
at Cornell University), EU and Danish funding (at DIKU and ITU).

Philippe is an expert on storage system
software. In this area, he contributed to the uFlip Benchmark, the Linux multiqueue block
layer, the Linux framework for Open-Channel SSDs, the OX architecture for computational
storage, the xNVMe library and Delilah, a prototype for eBPF offload on
computational storage.
Philippe was involved in the development of sensor networks in the early 2000s with
the Cougar project at Cornell, and the Hogthrob and Mana projects at U.Copenhagen. 
Philippe is co-author of a book on database tuning together with Dennis Shasha.

Philippe joined DIKU in 2001 as assistant professor in the Distlab group.
He was faculty at the IT University from 2009 to 2023, and he is now back at DIKU.
Before Denmark, Philippe worked as software engineer at ECRC in Munich, Germany
from 1993 to 1996, as a PhD student at GIE Dyade in Grenoble, France, and
as a postdoc and later research associate at Cornell University, NY, USA from 1999 to 2001.
In this period, Philippe had the priviledge to work under the supervision of Stephane Bressan at ECRC,
Anthony Tomasic at Dyade and Praveen Seshadri at Cornell. 

Philippe is a trustee of the VLDB Endowment and currently chairs the ACM EIG on Reproducibility
and Replicability.
